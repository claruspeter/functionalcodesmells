With the expansion and acceptance of functional programming in the commercial world certain patterns and anti-patterns are emerging.

This is an effort to document a comprehensive list of code smells that can appear in functional code.

## Code smells specific to Functional programmming 
These code smells are either unique to functional programming, or have a particular emphasis in the functional programming community.

- [Single letter variables](single-letter-variables)
- Functions with no output
- Mutable variables
- Immutable universe
- Null propagation
- Mixed code and data
- Record of functions

## Code smells that are shared with Object Oriented programming 
These code smells are nothing new and generally apply to functional programming just as much as they apply to object oriented programming.  For more details of what these smells are, and what to do about them, please see the references.
